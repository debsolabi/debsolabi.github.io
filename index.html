			    <b>Rabbits</b> are small mammals in the family <b class="taxonomy family">Leporidae</b> and in the order of <b class="taxonomy order">Lagomorpha</b> (along with the <b>hare</b> and the <b>pika</b>). Orcyctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendents, the world's most 305 breeds of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the 7 types of cottontail.

			    The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or <b>bunny</b>) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life-as food, clothing, a companion, and as a source of artistic inspiration.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In <i><b>terminology</b></i>, male rabbits are called <b>bucks</b>; females are called <b>does</b>. An older term for an adult rabbit is <b>coney</b>, while <b>rabbit</b> once referred only to the young animals. Another term for a young is <b>bunny</b>, though this term is often applied informally (especially by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit. <br><br>A group of rabbits is known as a <b>colony</b> or <b>nest</b> (or, occasionally, a <b>warren</b> though this more commonly refers to where the rabbit live). A group of baby rabbits procuced from a single mating is referred to as a <i><b>litter</b></i>, and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a <i><b>herd</b></i>.
